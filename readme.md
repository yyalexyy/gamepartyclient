## Running the Program
Run `npm i && npm start` for under both `./server/` and `./client/`
## Inspiration
The lockdown caused by COVID-19 has forced us to get creative when it comes down to hanging out with friends. Since leaving the house isn't safe these days, the best way to spend time with friends is through virtual game nights! Thus, we have decided to create a website to bring all the games into one page where everyone can have a good time!
> *Life was meant for good friends and great adventures*
## What is the App?
This is a React website that connects users with their friends, families, and co-workers to a few fun rounds of online games, including Cards Against Humanities. The website allows user to chat, vote for the next game to play, and, of course, play the game.

## How does it work?
Initially, the user enters their name and a room number. Then, the user gets to view and chat with the people in the same room while playing their favorite online games. After the round, everyone then can vote for the next game to play on the bottom on their screen.
